# Twitter Clone

This is a Twitter clone that I've created with React, TypeScript, SASS & Rust to demonstrate my full stack ability to build scalable frontends and backends.

## How to Run 🚀

**Step 1:**  
You need to navigate to the frontend directory:  
```
cd frontend
```

**Step 2:**  
Then you need to install all of the project's dependencies:  
```
yarn install
```

**Step 3:**  
Finally you can run the local development server:  
```
yarn dev
```

## Known Issues/Future Features 👾

1.  UI responsiveness breaks on **Home Screen** below 1440p.
    > I have been developing on a **1440p monitor** and will make sure 1080p and everything in between on desktop works. The goal is to make sure that even if the website isn't in a maximized window, things are displayed correctly. Mobile will be neglected as I'm only developing this for desktop only.
2.  **Timeline** doesn't display any posts.
    > **For You** and **Following** is tied into this because currently there's no way to be able to differentiate the two when you toggle between them.
3.  More **screens** need to be developed.
    > These screens include **Explore**, **Notifications**, **Messages**, **Grok**, **Lists**, **Bookmarks**, **Jobs**, **Communities**, **Premium Sign Up**, **Verified Orgs**, **Profile**, & **Settings**. The goal is to try to make every screen as 1:1 as possible.
4.  **Home Screen** buttons don't do anything currently.
    > All of the buttons exist in the UI but they don't do anything when clicked. The goal is to make sure **ALL** the buttons across the project work as intended even when the backend is fully developed.
5.  **Search Bar** needs to be further developed.
    > The Search Bar literally just exists as an input that doesn't actually search anything based on the typed query. A **modal** needs to be developed to display the recent searches, suggested trends/profiles, or the literal search query.
6.  **Messages Dock** needs to be further developed.
    > Similar to the Search Bar, the Messages Dock just exists and doesn't do anything. It needs to expand vertically when clicked and display the most recent Messages. A New Message Modal should also appear when its corresponding button gets added as well.
7.  Develop **Rust backend**.
    > Probably the most important thing I need to do once the frontend is done. Luckily I'm using Rust 🤓.

## Thank You for Reading! 😊

I mainly started this personal project because I wanted to showcase to future employers my full stack expertise but I also wanted to do something that is challenging yet fun. I know I still have a long way to go but hopefully my hard work doesn't go to waste and I'm able to convey my passion through my work 😁.
